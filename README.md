# ActiveTabHighlighterPlugin

What it is not:
- versatile, color customizable plugin
- best implementation you ever saw

What is it:
- minimum implementation plugin
- gets the job of distinct highlight of active tab done (I'm personally using Darcula theme, and this has been 
    a nightmare for me for quite a while, to see the active tab, amongst the others)
- yes, the highlight colour is somewhat pink, and I'm fine with it :)
- NOTE: this fork is less pink :)

Installation instructions:
- Download this release: https://github.com/depsypher/ActiveTabHighlighterPlugin/releases/download/toned-down-purple/ActiveTabHighlighterPlugin.jar

- In IntelliJ, go to File>Settings, click Plugins from the side tree.
- Click "Install plugin from disk" and point the downloaded jar.
